## Complete Conversation Summary
The user encountered a common Laravel deployment issue where after cloning their codebase from GitHub and attempting to run `php artisan serve`, they received a PHP warning about a missing `vendor/autoload.php` file. This is a typical problem that occurs because the `vendor` directory containing Composer dependencies is excluded from Git repositories via `.gitignore`.

I diagnosed the issue by examining the project structure and confirming that the `vendor` directory was missing, while also verifying that `/vendor` was indeed listed in the `.gitignore` file on line 21. The root cause was that when cloning a Laravel project, the Composer dependencies need to be installed separately since they're not included in the repository.

The solution involved running `composer install` to download and install all required PHP dependencies. However, during the installation process, I discovered an additional issue: there was a PSR-4 autoloading compliance problem with a middleware file. The file `CheckAccountLockou.php` had a typo in its filename - it was missing the final 't' and should have been named `CheckAccountLockout.php` to match the class name inside the file.

I fixed this filename issue by renaming the file from `CheckAccountLockou.php` to `CheckAccountLockout.php` using PowerShell's `Move-Item` command. This resolved the PSR-4 autoloading standard violation that was preventing proper autoload generation.

Multiple attempts were made to install the Composer dependencies using various approaches including `composer install`, `composer install --no-cache`, `composer install --ignore-platform-reqs`, and `composer update --no-interaction --prefer-dist`. The installation process was running in the background and showed progress with vendor directory population, though the final completion status was still pending at the end of our conversation.

The key technical insight is that Laravel projects require two essential steps after cloning: 1) Install Composer dependencies with `composer install`, and 2) Ensure all files follow PSR-4 naming conventions for proper autoloading. The user also had their `.env` file properly configured, which is another common requirement after cloning Laravel projects.
